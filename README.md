# Algorithm Design Course 98992

This repository contains my solutions for the assignments of Algorithm Design course at Iran University of Science and Technology.

The course is based on the [Data Structures and Algorithms](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-structures-algorithms) specialization on Coursera by University of California San Diego.

The solutions are written in C# and use Visual Studio as the IDE.
